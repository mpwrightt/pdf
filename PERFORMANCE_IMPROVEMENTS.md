# Performance Improvements with Convex

## Summary

**With Convex atomic coordination, removed ~20 seconds of waiting per SQ!**

---

## What Was Removed

### ❌ 10-Second Wait After Claiming SQ
**Before:**
```javascript
// Claim rows
setValue(CONFIG.BOT_ID)
Utilities.sleep(10000)  // Wait for other bots
// Verify we won
getValue() === CONFIG.BOT_ID ? success : retry
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Convex already guaranteed this SQ is ours
setValue(CONFIG.BOT_ID)
// Done! No wait, no verification needed
```

**Savings:** 10 seconds

---

### ❌ Final Check Before Claiming
**Before:**
```javascript
// Convex reserved it
// But double-check the sheet...
if (sheet.getValue()) {
  // Someone else claimed it! Retry
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Convex reserved it = guaranteed ours
// No need to check
```

**Savings:** 1 Google Sheets API call

---

### ❌ 10-Second Wait After Refund Log Write
**Before:**
```javascript
// Write data
setValue(data)
Utilities.sleep(10000)  // Wait for other bots
// Verify we won
getValue() === ourData ? success : retry
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Convex reserved rows for us
setValue(data)
// Done! No wait, no verification
```

**Savings:** 10 seconds + retry logic

---

## What Was Kept

### ✅ 5-Second Wait for PDF Link Formula
```javascript
Utilities.sleep(5000)  // Google Sheets needs time to calculate HYPERLINK formula
```

**Why:** Google Sheets formulas take time to calculate. This is not race-condition related.

### ✅ Retry Logic for API Calls
```javascript
for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= 3; attempt++) {
  try {
    callVercelAPI()
  } catch (transientError) {
    Utilities.sleep(500 * Math.pow(2, attempt))
    retry
  }
}
```

**Why:** Network issues can happen. This handles temporary failures.

## Total Time Savings

**Per SQ:**
- Before: ~30 seconds of waiting
- After: ~5 seconds (only PDF link formula)
- **Savings: ~25 seconds per SQ!**

**Per day (30 SQs):**
- Savings: 25s × 30 = **12.5 minutes saved**

**Per month (600 SQs):**
- Savings: 25s × 600 = **4+ hours saved**

---

## Why This Works

### Convex Provides:
1. **Atomic transactions** - Database guarantees operations
2. **ACID compliance** - Consistency guaranteed
3. **Single source of truth** - No data caching issues
4. **True mutual exclusion** - Only one bot can claim an SQ

### Old Approach (Write-Verify-Confirm):
```
BOT1: Write → Wait → Verify → Hope we won
BOT2: Write → Wait → Verify → Hope we won
Result: Maybe both win, maybe both lose
```

### New Approach (Convex Atomic):
```
BOT1: Ask Convex → Convex says YES → Guaranteed winner
BOT2: Ask Convex → Convex says NO (BOT1 has it) → Try next SQ
Result: Exactly one winner, no waiting
```

## Testing

**Before deploying to production:**
1. Test with 3 concurrent bots
2. Verify each gets different SQ
3. Check Convex dashboard shows no collisions
4. Monitor execution time in Apps Script logs

**Expected results:**
- No race conditions
- ~20 seconds faster per SQ
- Clean logs (no "lost race" warnings)

---

## Monitoring

**Convex Dashboard:**
- https://dashboard.convex.dev/t/matt-wright/refund-queue/energized-spoonbill-94/data
- Watch `sq_claims` table for concurrent access
- All claims should be unique (no duplicates)

**Apps Script Logs:**
- Should see: "✓ Convex reserved SQ..."
- Should NOT see: "⚠️ Lost race..." (if you do, Convex isn't working)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert to commit before performance improvements
2. The old verification logic will work (just slower)
3. Investigate Convex dashboard for errors

**Git command:**
```bash
git revert c74d48b
git push origin main
```

---

## Future Optimizations

Possible next steps:
1. **Batch API calls** - Reserve multiple SQs at once
2. **Parallel PDF processing** - Process while claiming
3. **Preload formulas** - Cache PDF links in memory

**Current bottleneck:** Google Sheets API rate limits (not Convex!)
