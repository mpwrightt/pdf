# Bug Fix: Double-Sided Cards with Spaces in Collector Numbers

## Issue Identified

**Date:** October 23, 2025

**Reported Card:** Treasure // Plot Double-Sided Token
- Set: Outlaws of Thunder Junction
- Collector #: `18 // 20`
- Rarity: T (Token)
- Expected Condition: Near Mint
- **Actual Result:** Empty condition field

## Root Cause

The PDF parser was unable to match double-sided token cards because:

1. **Spaces in collector numbers:** The collector number `18 // 20` contains spaces between the `//` separator
2. **Regex patterns too restrictive:** All 9+ parsing patterns used `[A-Za-z0-9/\-]+` which does NOT allow spaces
3. **Pattern failure cascade:** When the primary patterns failed to match, the card fell through to fallback patterns that also couldn't handle the spaces

### Example of Failed Pattern

**Before:**
```regex
pattern_standard = r'^(\d+)\s+(.+?)\s+-\s#([A-Za-z0-9/\-]+)\s+-\s+([A-Za-z ]+)\s+-\s+(.+?)\s+[A-Za-z\-\']+\s+-\s+(.+?)$'
```

This pattern expects: `1 Treasure // Plot Double-Sided Token - #18//20 - T - Near Mint Magic - Set`

But the actual PDF has: `1 Treasure // Plot Double-Sided Token - #18 // 20 - T - Near Mint Magic - Set`

The space in `18 // 20` breaks the match at the collector number position.

## Solution

Updated all collector number regex patterns to include `\s` (whitespace) in the character class:

**After:**
```regex
pattern_standard = r'^(\d+)\s+(.+?)\s+-\s#([A-Za-z0-9/\-\s]+?)\s+-\s+([A-Za-z ]+)\s+-\s+(.+?)\s+[A-Za-z\-\']+\s+-\s+(.+?)$'
```

Changed: `[A-Za-z0-9/\-]+` → `[A-Za-z0-9/\-\s]+?`

### Patterns Updated

All patterns that capture collector numbers were updated:

1. **Pattern 1** (line 186): Bin format with multiline set names
2. **Pattern 2** (line 226): Standard format without Bin prefix
3. **Pattern 8** (lines 245-246): Card line without game/set on same line
4. **Pattern 4** (line 636): Extreme split case
5. **Pattern 5** (line 683): Split case where condition is absent
6. **Pattern 6** (line 720): Split bin simple
7. **Pattern 7** (lines 724-725): Slot-letter prefix quantity
8. **Pattern 2b** (line 729): Standard format without '#'
9. **Robust Fallback** (lines 322-324): Header-like line stitching
10. **YGO Back-link Fallback** (lines 391-393): Yu-Gi-Oh header reconstruction
11. **Pattern 9** (lines 483-485): Header without quantity

## Impact

This fix resolves parsing issues for:
- ✅ Double-sided Magic cards with split collector numbers (e.g., `18 // 20`, `5 // 10`)
- ✅ Double-sided tokens from any set
- ✅ Any card where TCGplayer formats the collector number with spaces around `/`

## Testing

### Expected Behavior After Fix

When processing the same PDF:
```
Card: Treasure // Plot Double-Sided Token
Collector #: 18 // 20
Rarity: T
Condition: Near Mint  ← Should now be captured correctly
Set: Outlaws of Thunder Junction
```

### How to Verify

1. Re-upload the PDF `SQ_251013-264rmb_Sheets.pdf`
2. Check the API response for order `251012-C69A`
3. Verify the condition field is populated with the correct value (not empty)

**After Fix:**
