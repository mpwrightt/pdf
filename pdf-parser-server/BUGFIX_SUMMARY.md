# PDF Parser Bug Fixes - October 23, 2025

## Summary
Fixed multiple issues preventing proper extraction of card data and buyer names from TCGplayer Direct PDFs.

---

## Issue 1: Double-Sided Cards with Spaces in Collector Numbers
**Commit:** `c84c6b8`
**Date:** Oct 23, 2025 15:42

### Problem
Double-sided token cards like "Treasure // Plot Double-Sided Token" with collector number `18 // 20` were not being parsed because the spaces in the collector number prevented regex matching.

### Root Cause
All 11 regex patterns used `[A-Za-z0-9/\-]+` which does NOT allow spaces within collector numbers.

### Solution
Updated all patterns to use `[A-Za-z0-9/\-\s]+?` to allow whitespace in collector numbers.

### Patterns Updated
- Pattern 1 (Bin format)
- Pattern 2 (Standard format)
- Pattern 4-9 (All split/fallback patterns)
- Pattern 8 (Card without game/set)
- YGO back-link fallback
- Robust fallback patterns

### Example
**Before:** Failed to match `#18 // 20` (space between slashes)
**After:** Successfully matches `#18 // 20`, `#5 // 10`, etc.

## Issue 2: Split Card Format with Partial Condition
**Commit:** `2e90810`
**Date:** Oct 23, 2025 15:51

### Problem
Cards split across 3 lines with partial condition text were not being parsed:
```
Treasure // Plot Double-Sided Token - #18 // 20 - T - Near
Bin 1 1 Magic - Outlaws of Thunder Junction
Mint
```
The condition "Near Mint" was split across lines 1 and 3.

### Root Cause
No existing pattern handled cards where:
1. Card name + collector# + rarity + partial condition on line 1
2. Bin line with quantity and game-set on line 2
3. Remainder of condition on line 3

### Solution
Added **Pattern 5b** to detect partial conditions and combine them:
- Matches cards ending with partial condition (e.g., "Near")
- Looks for Bin line with game-set on next line
- Combines partial condition with text from third line
- Result: "Near" + "Mint" = "Near Mint"

### Code Location
Lines 685-755 in `api/parse.py`

## Issue 3: Buyer Names with Middle Initials
**Commit:** `736385f`
**Date:** Oct 23, 2025 15:54

### Problem
Buyer names with middle initials like "Brendan E White" were not being extracted.

### Root Cause
Name regex pattern required `[A-Za-z][a-z]+` (capital + at least one lowercase) for each name part. Single-letter middle initials like "E" don't have lowercase letters.

### Solution
Changed pattern from `[a-z]+` to `[a-z]*` (zero or more lowercase letters):
```regex
Before: [A-Za-z][a-z]+
After:  [A-Za-z][a-z]*
```

### Examples Fixed
- "Brendan E White" ✓
- "John Q Public" ✓
- "Mary A Smith" ✓

## Issue 4: Buyer Names with Hyphens
**Commit:** `c2d3321`
**Date:** Oct 23, 2025 16:03

### Problem
Buyer names with hyphenated last names like "Emily Bau-Madsen" were not being extracted.

### Root Cause
Name regex pattern didn't include hyphens in the allowed character set.

### Solution
Added `\-` to the character class for name parts:
```regex
Before: [A-Za-z][a-z]*
After:  [A-Za-z][a-z\-]*
```

### Examples Fixed
- "Emily Bau-Madsen" ✓
- "Jean-Luc Picard" ✓
- "Mary-Kate Olsen" ✓

### Final Pattern
The buyer name pattern now supports:
```regex
([A-Za-z][a-z\-]*(?:[ \t]+[A-Za-z]\'?[A-Za-z\-]*)+)\s*\n\s*(\d+[ \t]+[\w \t]+)
```

This handles:
- Middle initials: "Brendan E White"
- Hyphenated names: "Emily Bau-Madsen"
- Apostrophes: "Patrick O'Brien"
- Regular names: "John Smith"

## Issue 5: Buyer Names with PO BOX and Military Addresses
**Commit:** `ffab6d2`
**Date:** Oct 23, 2025 16:51

### Problem
Buyer names were not extracted when the address was a PO BOX or military CMR address instead of a traditional street address.

### Root Cause
Name regex pattern required address to start with street number (`\d+`). PO BOX and CMR addresses don't follow this format:
- PO BOX: "PO BOX 1406, Las Piedras PR"
- CMR (military): "CMR 473 Box 546"

### Solution
Expanded pattern to match multiple address formats using alternation:
```regex
Before: \d+[ \t]+[\w \t]+
After:  (?:(?:\d+[ \t]+[\w \t]+)|(?:PO[ \t]+BOX[ \t]+[\w\-]+)|(?:CMR[ \t]+\d+[ \t]+Box[ \t]+\d+))
```

### Examples Fixed
- "Anthony Rodriguez" with "PO BOX 1406" ✓
- "Brian Nambo" with "CMR 473 Box 546" ✓
- Still works with "2895 Tower Rd" ✓

## Issue 6: Buyer Names with Reverse Format and Periods
**Commit:** `26b8237`
**Date:** Oct 23, 2025 17:13

### Problem
Buyer names were not extracted when formatted in non-standard ways:
- **Reverse format**: "Petteway, Nicholas" (Last, First instead of First Last)
- **Initials with periods**: "R. Jeremy" (period after initial)

### Root Cause
Name regex pattern didn't allow:
- Commas as separators between name parts
- Periods after initials or name components

### Solution
Enhanced pattern to support commas and periods:
```regex
Before: [A-Za-z][a-z\-]*(?:[ \t]+[A-Za-z]\'?[A-Za-z\-]*)+
After:  [A-Za-z][a-z\-]*\.?(?:[ \t,]+[A-Za-z]\'?[A-Za-z\-]*\.?)+
```

Changes:
- `\.?` allows optional period after each name part
- `[ \t,]+` allows comma as separator (in addition to space/tab)

### Examples Fixed
- "Petteway, Nicholas" (reverse with comma) ✓
- "R. Jeremy" (initial with period) ✓
- "J. R. R. Tolkien" (multiple periods) ✓
- All previous formats still work ✓

## Issue 7: Buyer Names with Non-Standard Address Formats
**Commits:** `4be3233` (initial), `0669b50` (scope fix), `0bd2267` (international/Hawaiian)
**Date:** Oct 23, 2025 17:30-18:00

### Problem
Buyer names were not extracted when addresses used non-standard formats:
- Wisconsin-style: "N58W23783 Hastings Ct" (alphanumeric with directional prefix)
- Hawaiian: "91-111 MAKAALOA PL" (hyphenated house numbers)
- Puerto Rico: "HC 3 BOX 37578" (Highway Contract)
- Rural: "RR 2 Box 123" (Rural Route)

### Root Cause (Initial)
Name regex pattern required addresses to start with a digit (`\d+`), excluding alphanumeric and special regional formats.

### Solution (Phase 1 - Commit 4be3233)
Broadened address pattern to accept alphanumeric starts:
```regex
Before: \d+[ \t]+[\w \t]+
After:  [A-Za-z0-9]+[ \t]+[\w \t]+
```

### Problem (Regression)
The broadened pattern was too permissive and matched seller names and set names from the "Included Orders" table. Examples:
- "Commander Masters" (set name)
- "The List Reprints" (set name)
- "Included Orders" (table header)

### Solution (Phase 2 - Commit 0669b50)
Restricted search scope to only the "Shipping Address" section:
- Extract text between `Shipping Address\n` and `Shipping Method:`
- Search only within that section
- Take first match (recipient name)
- Added exclusions: "Included Orders", "Seller Name", "Order Number"

### Problem (Hawaiian/International)
Hawaiian addresses with hyphenated house numbers ("91-111") and Puerto Rico HC addresses were not matching because hyphen wasn't in character class `[A-Za-z0-9]+`.

### Solution (Phase 3 - Commit 0bd2267)
Added hyphen support and explicit patterns for regional formats:
```regex
Main pattern: [A-Za-z0-9\-]+[ \t]+[A-Za-z0-9 \t]+
HC pattern: HC[ \t]+\d+[ \t]+BOX[ \t]+[\w\-]+
RR pattern: RR[ \t]+\d+[ \t]+Box[ \t]+[\w\-]+
```

### All Supported Address Formats
- ✅ Regular: "123 Main St"
- ✅ Wisconsin: "N58W23783 Hastings Ct"
- ✅ Hawaiian: "91-111 MAKAALOA PL"
- ✅ Puerto Rico HC: "HC 3 BOX 37578"
- ✅ Puerto Rico HC: "HC 5 BOX 10666"
- ✅ Rural Route: "RR 2 Box 123"
- ✅ PO BOX: "PO BOX 1406"
- ✅ Military CMR: "CMR 473 Box 546"
- ✅ Military APO: "APO AP 96555"
- ✅ Military FPO: "FPO AE 09499"

### Verified Names Extracted
- "Ryan Nelsen-Freund" (Wisconsin address)
- "Jordan Hunt" (Hawaiian address)
- "Fernando Gonzalez" (Puerto Rico HC)
- "Manuel A Geraldino" (Puerto Rico HC with middle initial)

## Known Limitations

1. **Pattern Complexity:** The parser now has 12+ regex patterns which can be difficult to maintain
2. **Edge Cases:** Some extremely unusual PDF formats may still fail
3. **Performance:** Multiple regex passes may be slow on very large PDFs

## Future Improvements

1. Consolidate overlapping patterns to reduce complexity
2. Add comprehensive test suite with edge cases
3. Consider using PDF structure (tables) instead of pure text extraction
4. Add debug mode to log which pattern matched each card

- ✅ Handles double-sided cards with space-separated collector numbers
- ✅ Extracts buyer names with all format variations:
  - Middle initials (Brendan E White)
  - Hyphens (Emily Bau-Madsen, Ryan Nelsen-Freund)
  - Reverse format (Petteway, Nicholas)
  - Periods (R. Jeremy)
  - PO BOX addresses
  - Military CMR addresses
  - Alphanumeric street addresses (N58W23783 Hastings Ct)
- ✅ Properly combines split condition text across multiple lines
- ✅ No regression on previously working PDFs
